\section{\bf  Design and Implementation}

  \normalfont \indent The team started this assignment by first researching the allocation algorithms present in the Linux Kernel. To handle memory allocations that are smaller than a page, one of three allocation algorithms are used: SLAB, SLUB, and SLOB.  SLAB and SLUB are more complex allocation algorithms that are often much more effecient than SLOB.  SLAB allocation works be pre-allocating memory in caches so that when a request to allocate memory is recieved, it can immediatly fill that request.  Unlike SLOB, SLAB eliminates fragmentation due to it allocating an entire "slab" at once.  SLUB was created as a response to the SLAB allocator, which requires a lot of overhead to operate.  SLUB creates a \textit{slab} similar to the SLAB algorithm, but it will manipulate these slabs as needed, such as modifying queue sizes, merging slabs, and partial slabs.  Also, instead of storing metadata about the slab at the beginning of the block, SLUB keeps the metadata in a page struct, meaning that the data stored in the slab will be aligned to the block and fit within a 4k block without needing extra space. 
  \normalfont \indent For this assignment we will be comparing outbest-fit allocation scheme to a SLOB implimentation.  SLOB is a first-fit algorithm, meaning that when served with a request it will reference a list of free blocks, allocating to the first one that is large enough for the request.  This can result in a large amount of fragmentation because the first block that fits may not be the optimal block. The best fit algorithm that we will be creating will try and place blocks in the best spot, so there is less fragmentation.
  \normalfont \indent Our algorithm will be extremely similar to the fist fit algorithm.  The first fit algorithm already keeps an internal list of free blocks.  Because it is a linked list, we wouldn't normally be able to perform a proper binary search.  To speed up searching without the ability to randomly access members, we can use a skip list.  

\section{\bf Questions}
        \textbf{What do you think the main point of this assignment is?}\\
                \normalfont \indent The purpose of this assignment was to learn about how memory is allocated at the kernel level. Usually programs use virtual memory provided by the kernel to allocate objects and store information.  With this assignment we looked at the different types of algorithms, and their various shortfalls.  The SLOB allocator that we were comparing against was pretty simple to grasp, making it easier grasp how memory allocation and management work. Additionally, we had to understand and write algorithms that would result in fitting requests into the optimal memory location. \\\\
